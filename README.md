# AppInstanceChecker  

**AppInstanceChecker** is a simple C# Windows Forms application that ensures only a single instance of the app can run at any given time. It utilizes a named mutex to detect if the application is already running, providing a user-friendly notification if an attempt is made to launch a second instance.  

## Features  

- **Single Instance Enforcement**: Prevents multiple instances of the application from running simultaneously.  
- **User Notification**: Displays an alert when a user tries to launch an already running instance.  
- **Lightweight and Easy to Use**: A straightforward implementation designed for C# Windows Forms applications.  

## Installation
