# AppInstanceChecker
AppInstanceChecker is a simple C# Windows Forms application designed to ensure that only a single instance of the app can be run at any given time. This application utilizes a named mutex to detect whether the app is already running and provides a user-friendly notification if an attempt is made to launch a second instance.
